# Coursework2-WebApp-Vuejs-MDXdubai

This project is my course work 2 at middlesex university dubai for my BSc in Information Tehcnology
Module Name: Web based Mobile app development

This project is the continuation of course work 1 which you can find on my github
In this project I have used mongodb and vue js to create an after school classes page, where students can buy seats in these classes.

The data is saved in mongodb and I use server.js to extract data through CRUD operations and fetch the data on index.html
